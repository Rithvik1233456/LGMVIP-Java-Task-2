A Tic Tac Toe game has been developed using the Java programming language. The game provides a user interface where two players can take turns to play on a 3x3 grid. Each player is represented by a symbol, typically 'X' and 'O.' The Java code handles the game's logic, checking for winning conditions and ensuring valid moves. It may include features like player input validation, winning combinations detection, and displaying the game's outcome. This Java Tic Tac Toe implementation offers a fun and interactive experience, making it a popular choice for educational purposes and as a recreational programming project.
